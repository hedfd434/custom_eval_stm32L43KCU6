custom_eval_stm32L43KCU6 project overview:



MCU: STM32L432KCU6 (in 32-UFQFPN (5x5) package)

functionality:
1. USB port (usb-c if possible, if not use micro) -  for communication and power supply
2. all of external oscylators (HSE, LSE)
3. exposed SWDIO port like on blue pill
4. overall from similar to black pill/arduino mini/or what is the best (just keep the layout of gpio pins compatible with 2.54mm standard)
5. keep components on one side
6. add power indicator diode and one control diode
7. power pins:
	put them rather in one section like on stm32 boards
	- 5 x 3V3
	- 7 x GND (or more if there is odd number of pins)
	- 2 x VBUS 5V

to do:





- figure out where to connect a usb_noe (MCU) and usb_id (usb micro)



- consider bigger fuse (buy 2 types in 0603 package) (finally 300mA in the same package)

- put logo on it

- finish excel with elements (update after resistor changesS)







done:
- choose footprint for usb-c USB_C_Receptacle_Molex_105450-0101 (done)
- check if BOOT0 button should be pulled (just pull it down ) (done)
- debug port (done)
- led's (done)

- choose shape (try blackpill, different amount of gpio pins) (kinda done)

- calculate load capacitors values (done)
- add buttons (NRST. BOOTX, USER_1, USER_1 and USER_2 with o ohm resistors as enablers (done)
- learn about usb interface on pcb's (done...)
- check sizing (done)
- reverse power for ldo (done)
- connectors with 2 labels (done, finally 1 label)
- make smooth edges (done)
- find pros and cons about connecting usb-c port shield to shield (connected to gnd with micro usb, in others evals it is connected to gnd)
- choose ferrite bead (done)
