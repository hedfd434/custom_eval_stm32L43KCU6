custom_eval_stm32L43KCU6 project overview:



MCU: STM32L432KCU6 (in 32-UFQFPN (5x5) package)

functionality:
1. USB port (usb-c if possible, if not use micro) -  for communication and power supply
2. all of external oscylators (HSE, LSE)
3. exposed SWDIO port like on blue pill
4. overall from similar to black pill/arduino mini/or what is the best (just keep the layout of gpio pins compatible with 2.54mm standard)
5. keep components on one side
6. add power indicator diode and one control diode
7. 

to do:

- choose ferrite bead

- learn about usb interface on pcb's

- choose footprint for usb-c USB_C_Receptacle_Molex_105450-0101 (done)

- figure out where to connect a usb_noe

- find pros and cons about connecting usb-c port shield to shield

- add buttons (NRST. BOOTX, USER_1, USER_2), USER_1 and USER_2 with o ohm resistors as enablers

- check if BOOT0 button should be pulled
