custom_eval_stm32L43KCU6 project overview:



MCU: STM32L432KCU6 (in 32-UFQFPN (5x5) package)

functionality:
1. USB port (usb-c if possible, if not use micro) -  for communication and power supply
2. all of external oscylators (HSE, LSE)
3. exposed SWDIO port like on blue pill
4. overall from similar to black pill/arduino mini/or what is the best (just keep the layout of gpio pins compatible with 2.54mm standard)
5. keep components on one side
6. add power indicator diode and one control diode
7. power pins:
	put them rather in one section like on stm32 boards
	- 5 x 3V3
	- 10 x GND (or more if there is odd number of pins)
	- 3 x VBUS 5V

to do:

- choose ferrite bead

- learn about usb interface on pcb's

- figure out where to connect a usb_noe

- find pros and cons about connecting usb-c port shield to shield

- add buttons (NRST. BOOTX, USER_1, USER_2), USER_1 and USER_2 with o ohm resistors as enablers


- reverse power for ldo

- consider bigger fuse

- connectors with 2 labels

- led's

- choose shape (try blackpill, different amount of gpio pins)


done:
- choose footprint for usb-c USB_C_Receptacle_Molex_105450-0101 (done)
- check if BOOT0 button should be pulled (just pull it down ) (done)
- debug port (done)
